# GET request

    - A Get request as we recall is for 'getting' data
    - This can be requesting an entire webpage, or requesting data that we can manipulate for our webpage.

    - In the context of this course, we will always be using axios to get and manipulate data rather than receiving an entire webpage.


    - For these lessons we will be using the V school Todo API as it will allow us to practice all four of the HTTP methods we are learning.  The documentation can be found here:

# Put Request 

    - The put request is for updating an existing item in a database
    - The method will need both the id of the item to update, and the data in which it will be updated with.
